ESG guidelines, maximizing the investment potential and consequent appreciation of the

If, so far, involvement with the ESG guidelines has come to be seen as a growing
need for the creation of good business practices, it is foreseeable that, in a short time
time, this is a reality that is well cemented in the way that all stakeholders
perceive a particular company, through its conformity and commitment to
methods that meet ESG best practices.

The business need to migrate to business models in
compliance with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria is growing and
notorious. Added to this is the usefulness and convenience of complying with the SDGs
(Sustainable Development Goals) of the UN.
<br><br>
ESG criteria are used by relevant financial institutions and investors, in accordance with
in order to analyze a company\'s compliance and assess whether, and how, it should receive
investments. Being well positioned in the ESG Rating was, until recently, an asset
differentiating, but soon it will be normal. Rating results start to
contained in a document that demonstrates the extent to which a company is committed
with ESG guidelines. Our goal is to minimize the risks arising from lack of management
according to the framework, as well as to correct legal gaps, leading to a trajectory of
continuous improvement.
<br><br>
Finally, all the information is compiled into a report that, once a year, the
companies publish. Its relevance and importance lies in showing stakeholders
how does the company act in commitment to the Environmental, Social and Health pillars
Governance (ESG).
